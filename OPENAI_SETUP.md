# Adding Real AI Suggestions

The Travel Planner currently uses demo data for AI suggestions. To enable real AI-powered itinerary and packing list generation, you need to add an OpenAI API key.

## Steps to Enable Real AI Suggestions:

1. **Get an OpenAI API Key:**
   - Go to [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - Sign up or log in to your account
   - Navigate to "API Keys" in your account settings
   - Create a new API key

2. **Add the API Key to your environment:**
   - Open `backend\.env` file
   - Replace this line:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=
     ```
   - With:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     ```

3. **Restart the backend server:**
   - Stop the current backend process
   - Run the startup script again: `.\start-servers.ps1`

4. **Test the AI suggestions:**
   - Go to any itinerary in the app
   - Click the "AI Suggestions" button
   - You should now get real AI-generated travel plans!
